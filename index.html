            <p class="text-gray-600">Coming December of 2028! Eclipse of Eternity is the ultimate MMO-RPG game where an interdimensional meteor crashes into the world in all timelines except for one—where a single wizard managed to stop the meteor. It's rumored that the Elder Dragon is the only one who can vanquish such a powerful interstellar object. However, a ruthless clan called The Titanoids have been keeping the dragon asleep under its own will. Will you be able to stop these big and powerful foes, awaken the dragon, and destroy the meteor?<br>Sign up on the official website, <a href="https://eclipseofeternity.online">eclipseofeternity.online</a> and my team will send you one year of game playtime for free when the game launches!</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600">PSA to anyone taking my course, you'll get a job referral at the end! That's right! I'll refer you directly to the AI company where I earned enough money to make it out of the slums in college and get to where I am now. With this job, you can make about $1200 to $1500 a week if you work for 40 hours. Colleges only meet once a week and are tailored to help hundreds of kids at once, which causes overwhelmed professors to inadequately prepare thousands of students for the computer science job market. In my course, I train people on the same college-level algorithms in just 5% of the time you'd spend taking the classes at an educational institution, with a guaranteed job referral that pays $30 or more per hour, plus hundreds extra in bonuses after completing the course. If you pass the company's test, the job is yours!</p>
